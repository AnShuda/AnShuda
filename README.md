### 📌 Featured Projects

1. **Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs in COVID-19 Scientific QA**  
   🔹 Built a knowledge base from **50 CORD-19 papers** and created **50 standardized MCQs**  
   🔹 Evaluated **27 LLMs** in RAG-enabled vs. RAG-disabled settings, with dual prompt versions  
   🔹 Key finding: RAG impact is inconsistent; positive gain in ~22% (V1) vs. ~63% (V2) of models
